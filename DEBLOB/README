This is the dir containing files
used for deblobbing the ports tree.

./deblob.py is the script used to deblob.

./LICENSES contains a list of free/non-free licenses, and is for reference.

./Whitelist is a file used and generated by ./deblob.py-- any port listed in ./Whitelist skips checks and is accepted as libre.

./Blacklist is a file used and generated by ./deblob.py-- any port listed in ./Blacklist is automatically removed if it is found.

./BlacklistI is (yet another freakin') file used and generated by ./deblob.py--
any port listed in ./BlacklistI isn't included in ../INDEX.temp


If you'd like to help with deblobbing, run the deblob.py script.
When it asks if a port is free or non-free, check the license of the program by reading the port's Makefile (a license is often listed there) by comparing the license to ./LICENSES. If the Makefile doesn't list a license (in a commented out line, FYI), then you'll have to do a little more digging. I'd recommend using "make fetch" on a local ports tree, extracting the source code, and checking the license. (Suspiciously!) Helpful "COPYING" or "LICENSE" files are often there.

When the deblobbing process is done (meaning there are no more programs not on the ./Whitelist or ./Blacklist[I]), you'll notice every directory (I.E. ../astro/Makefile.temp and ../astro/CVS/Entries.temp) has a few temp files. When you're ready and the deblobbing process is done, remove the original files and replace them with the temp files. When the deblobbing process is *100% CERTAINLY DONE*, remove the original ../INDEX file and replace it with ../INDEX.temp.

NOTE: Don't replace the actual files with the temp files until the deblob.py script allows rebranding & fixes the management of Makefile headers!

TODO:
- Work on making the deblob.py script better
- Work on deblob.py rebranding Makefiles
- Fix deblob.py's "management" of Makefile headers
- Finish deblobbing the ports (just a few thousand ports left, no big deal)

Cheers~
